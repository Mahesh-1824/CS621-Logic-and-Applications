# Readme

This repository contains Python scripts for solving three different questions using the Z3 solver. Before running the scripts, ensure that you have Python 3 and the Z3 solver installed on your PC.

## Initial Requirements

To run the provided Python scripts, you need to have Python 3 and the Z3 solver installed on your computer. You can run the scripts as follows:

- In Windows: `python filename.py`
- In Linux: `python3 filename.py`

## Question 1


## Question 2

This script reads input data from a file named `2.txt`. The file format is as follows:

- Line 1: Names of vertices separated by spaces.
- Subsequent lines: Pairs of vertices with an edge between them, one pair per line.

### Sample Input (2.txt):
A B C D
A B
A C
A D
B D
C D

## Question 3

This script reads input data from a file named `3.txt`. The file format is as follows:

- Line 1: Elements of the first row of the matrix, separated by spaces.
- Subsequent lines: Elements of the matrix, one row per line.

### Sample Input (3.txt):
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
